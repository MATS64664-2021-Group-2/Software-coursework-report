\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}

\noindent
The HCC value is reduced when there are less hydrides in the microstructure.

\noindent
The HCC value is lower when there is a preferred direction in the shape of the hydrides.

\noindent
For future work, it would be interesting to introduce into the model the calculations of other parameters such as the RHF and the RHCF.
