%========= Introduction
\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The presence of hydrides in Zr-alloys}

\justify
\noindent
Zr alloys are widely employed as fuel cladding in the nuclear sector. When corrosion occurs in nuclear reactors, the released hydrogen penetrates into the cladding alloy. This material absorbs part of it but, once the solubility limit is reached, hydrogen precipitates into brittle hydrides platelets. Generally, the hydrides orient along the tube circumferential direction, but they may orient radially too. Cladding usually fails by a hoop stress, so radial hydrides will lead the alloy to fail earlier in deformation processes. Moreover, crack propagation through cladding thickness is alarming, and this occurrence will be especially facilitated by radial-oriented hydrides. As cladding alloys fail more easily under the presence of radial hydrides, it is important to study the changes in hydride orientation to control cladding embrittlement \cite{SIMON2021152817, COLAS2013586, SHARMA2018546, SUNIL2020152457}.

\noindent
Cladding failure under hoop stress is strongly  affected by these three factors:

\vspace{0.1 mm}
- Hydrogen and hydride content.

\vspace{0.1 mm}
- Fraction of radially-oriented hydrides.

\vspace{0.1 mm}
- Continuity in the hydrides along the thickness of the cladding \cite{SIMON2021152817}.

\noindent
To measure the two last factors, parameters as the Radial Hydride Fraction (RHF), the hydride continuity coefficient (HCC) and the Radial Hydride Continuity Factor (RHCF) are used. The RHF, always between 0 and 1, represents the fraction of radially-oriented hydrides. Higher values of this parameter are related to more propagation of the cracks through the cladding thickness. But some microstructures with different hydrides locations may have the same RHF value in some cases, as it is shown in Figure 1. Therefore, it is also necessary to measure the continuity the hydrides. The HCC and RHCF determine how close the hydride platelets are to each other and show radial hydrides alignment across the cladding thickness, which is related to cracking propagation through the cladding thickness. These parameters, generally between 0 and 1, the higher they are, the more connected the hydrides across the thickness of the material will be \cite{SIMON2021152817}.

    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Parameter calculations}


\noindent
RHF corresponds to the weight average of hydride length multiplied by a weighting factor. The formula employed is described below:

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \raggedleft
    \includegraphics[width=4.3in]{RHF.JPG}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}


\noindent
Where $L_i$ is the length of each hydride and $f_i$ is the weighting factor, a parameter that has different values depending on the hydrides orientation. Hydrides with orientations between $0^0-40^0$ to the transverse direction have a $f_i$ of 0, when the orientation is between $40^0$ and $65^0$, the $f_i$ is 0.5, and hydrides with an orientation of $65–90^0$ have a $f_i$ of 1 \cite{COLAS2013586}. 

\noindent
To calculate the HCC, a rectangular area in the micrograph of the alloy is separated, and the length of each radial hydride in that area is measured. The formula applied is shown below:


\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \raggedleft
    \includegraphics[width=4.3in]{HCC.JPG}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Where $HC_i$ is the length of each radial hydride and L is the height of the selected rectangle to measure \cite{SIMON2021152817}.

\noindent
To calculate the RHCF, the length of each radial hydride in a section of the cladding is measured. This time, the section will have a length of 150 µm along the arc length of the cladding, and the width will be all the cladding thickness. The formula applied in this case is:

\begin{figure}[h] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
    \raggedleft
    \includegraphics[width=4.5in]{RHCF.JPG}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

\vspace{150}
\noindent
Where $L_i$ is the length of each radial hydride within the 150 µm of arc length, and $h_m$ is the cladding thickness \cite{SIMON2021152817}.
